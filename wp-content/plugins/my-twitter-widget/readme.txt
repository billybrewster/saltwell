== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**I have tried many widgets found for Wordpress and they all lack something. What makes this one different?**

* Well we tried to keep the entire widget as simple as possible yet still provide you with options. The number one item most people complain about is how the widget looks on their site compared to the rest of their site. It either looks like a big sore thumb on their site or the way the twitter feeds are formatted look horrible and sloppy. We tried to resolve this problem by providing options for the css of the widget. You have several options you can choose from without any css knowledge and if none of those work you can override the css using the css field to style the widget to look in uniform with your site.

**Sometimes my feeds stop working**

* Often times twitter is updating their system, and the feeds will disappear from time to time. If there do not return after several hours then you can contact us and we will look into the problem.

**I have changed twitter usernames, but its still showing my old account feeds**

* You need to clean the cache of the browser you are using or your wordpress site. The widget is designed to cashe the feeds to provide a quicker more real time display as you tweet, therefore it will tell your browser to store and use the same data. If after clearing the cache from both your website and brower you still experience problems please contact us.

Had some comments about the tweets not refreshing often enough. Cleaned up some of the code and added a few lines to ask the widget to refresh every 3 minutes.

= 1.3.9 =
Corrupted files with lastest update. Mxes file from another component so the system thinks it got the wrong version. Please be sure and up date to the latest version.

= 1.4 =
USers where complaining that the plugin was not showing their tweets sometimes so we changed the refresh rate to refresh quicket to try and keep the tweets fresh.

= 1.5 =
This update brings the plugin up to date to use Twitters OAuth settings and requires a consumer key, token and a few other API keys. This is a complete overhaul and pretty much a brand new plugin. Since Twitter has changed their API rules and you can not longer access their API without the proper access the plugin had to be rebuilt. If your tweets have stopped showing then you need this update. You will need to create an account on the application section of Tweeter. You can do so by logging in <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps/4665311/oauth">HERE</a> using your twitter account login information. The plugin still works with your themes css and will be styled to match all of your other plugins and/or widgets.

= 1.6.0 =
Was having problems with last update so we did a complete redesign of the plugin giving you more control over the look of the plugin. You can now change the border, background and font color of your plugin. If you are using a version older than 1.5 then we recommend that you update your plugin now as your tweets have probably stopped working.

Some people are claiming to have problems when upgrading or installing the plugin. We think it maybe some conflict with another plugin or something. As it does not do this for every person and it maybe 1% of all that are using it that has this problem. In order for us to try and identify the problem any feedback you can provide would be great. We have tried to install the plugin under many different scenarios and have been unable to reproduce the issue.
